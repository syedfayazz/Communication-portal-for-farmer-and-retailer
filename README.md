# Farmer-Retailer-Communication-Portal-PHP-Project
Provide a direct communication between the farmer and retailer 
   I like provide direct interaction place to the farmer, here farmers can fix their own price to their own product.
   
   
   Here 5 modules are available:::::::::: 
     1.Step-into-portal
     2. Retailer
     3. Farmer 
     4. Communication portal
     5. Admin
     
     Here I use simple css design and php.
     1->Step-into-portal
          In this module farmer and retailer register into portal. Admin can check where the users are authorized person then admin can  allow the into the portal.
     2->Retailer 
          She/he can register their personal details into this portal. They allowed to order the product from farmer.
          Yes they can send a request to farmer in contain product name and quantity.
     3->Farmer
          Farmer can showcase their product with name, quantity, price of the product into the portal. And farmer can directly get the               request from retailer if it is ok to the farmer then the farmer can accept request.
     4->Communication portal
          Farmer can post their availability into this portal. And health discussion are allowed.
     5->Admin
          Admin can monitoring all the actives done by farmer and retailer. If admin can found any illegal communication admin can block that user.
      
      Conclusion 
           Basic communication portal only I created. In future we want to intro online money transferring, transport booking facility also.
